# My Python Learning Journey üêç

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of basic Python scripts I wrote while learning the fundamentals of the language. Each file represents a small exercise or concept I was exploring at the time.

## About These Scripts

These scripts were created in May 2022 and cover foundational programming concepts. They are organized by the date they were created and demonstrate different aspects of Python syntax and functionality.

### üóìÔ∏è May 13th Scripts

A collection of scripts focusing on basic functions, loops, and error handling.

* **`513_1.py`**: Demonstrates robust input handling using `try...except` blocks to catch `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.
* **`513_2.py`**: Shows how a function can return multiple values, which are then unpacked into separate variables.
* **`513_3.py`**: A simple function that uses a `for` loop to print a string multiple times.
* **`513_4.py`**: A function that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given integer `x` using the formula `(1+x)*x/2`.
* **`513_5.py`**: A function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

### üóìÔ∏è May 20th Scripts

These scripts explore more advanced function features.

* **`520_1.py`**: Covers functions with default parameter values and returning multiple items in a list.
* **`520_2.py`**: An example of a higher-order function‚Äîa function that takes another function as an argument (`callbbb` takes `bbb`).
* **`520_3.py`**: Shows how to store functions in a list and iterate through them to call each one.
* **`520_4.py`**: Demonstrates functions that can accept a variable number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).

## üí° Core Concepts Covered

This project touches on several key Python concepts:

* **Functions**: Defining and calling functions.
* **Control Flow**: `while` and `for` loops.
* **Error Handling**: Using `try...except` to manage exceptions.
* **Data Types**: Working with numbers, strings, and lists.
* **Advanced Functions**:
    * Default argument values.
    * Returning multiple values.
    * Passing functions as arguments.
    * Variable arguments with `*args` and `**kwargs`.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run any of these scripts, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For example, to run `513_1.py`, you would use:

```bash
python 513_1.py
```

## `.gitignore` File

[cite_start]This project includes a standard Python `.gitignore` file. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4] This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore, such as:
* [cite_start]Compiled Python files (`*.pyc`) [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]Distribution folders (`/dist`, `/build`) [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]Virtual environment folders (`/venv`, `.env`) [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]Test and coverage reports (`.coverage`, `htmlcov/`) [cite: 1]

This keeps the repository clean and focused only on the essential source code.
